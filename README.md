###### Functionalities implemented

This application retrieves the data of Oompa Loompa workers and displays it as a list. When a worker's card is clicked, it displays that worker's detailed information, including full name, age, height, interests, etc... In order to make long texts easier to read, a "Read more" functionality has been implemented.

A small **test** has been implemented to test that the total number of pages is correctly incremented.
