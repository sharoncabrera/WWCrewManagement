###### Functionalities implemented

Application that **loads a list** of Oompa Loompa workers and displays it in a list. If you click on a card, it will take you to the **worker's detail**, where you can see their full name, age, height, interests etc... to make reading long texts easier, a "Read more" functionality has been implemented.

On the worker listing screen, you can **filter** by gender, profession, or both by clicking on the upper right part of the topbar, this will allow you to show or hide filters.

A small **test** has been implemented to test that the total number of pages is correctly incremented.
